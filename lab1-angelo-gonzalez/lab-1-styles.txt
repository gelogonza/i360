<!-- Internal style sheet for use in Lab 1 -->

<!-- 
    Styles for a single page placed in a <style> tag are called an "internal stylesheet".
    To declare these styles as part of your page, place the code below into the head.
    Ideally this code lives underneath the boilerplate already inside your head.

    To apply styles, you'll need to connect them to the HTML.
    The `img` is connected by using an HTML image tag (<img>).
    The `container` is connected by using an HTML tag with a class on it to identify it by name.
    To see how this works, wrap `<div class="container">   </div>` around the content in the body.
    Your page should look a little better than if you had not applied any styles at all.

<style>
    .container {
        width: 720px;
        margin: 35px auto; /* centers the container */
        border: 1px solid black;
        padding: 50px;
    }
    img {
        /* forces images to pay attention to width of the div named 'container', which is its parent */
        width: 100%;
        display: block;
    }
</style>
