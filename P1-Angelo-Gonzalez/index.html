        <p>
          I have been working on this recipe for longer than any other recipe
          I&apos;ve ever worked on. The number of times I&apos;ve told Erin,
          &quot;Sure, go ahead and put it on the schedule for next week,&quot;
          only to swap it out at the last minute because I wasn&apos;t happy
          with the results is a number higher than I care to count. But at long
          last, I&apos;m pretty darn pleased with the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all started when the good folks at Columbus Food Adventures took me
          on a whirlwind taco tour of Columbus, Ohio, which, believe it or not,
          has some of the finest taco trucks in the country. Particularly
          impressive were the tacos al pastor from Taqueria Los Guachos.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, in true al pastor form, the taqueras marinate thin, thin slices
          of pork shoulder in a mixture of chilies and aromatics colored bright
          red with achiote. The slices are then stacked onto a vertical skewer,
          forming a large, bell-shaped trompo (spinning top), which gets topped
          with an onion and pineapple, and slowly rotates in front of a vertical
          grill. If there&apos;s a reason it resembles shawarma or doner kebab,
          it&apos;s because the concept was first introduced to Mexico by
          Lebanese immigrants.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the trompo spins, it slowly cooks, the fat from the pork shoulder
          dripping out and across the surface of the meat, basting it as it
          crisps. As each outer layer of meat crisps up, the taquera shaves it
          off with a sharp knife, catching it in a soft corn tortilla before
          topping it with a bit of the roasted pineapple, salsa, cilantro, and
          onions. It&apos;s really glorious stuff. Juicy and crisp with a deep
          chili flavor tempered by sweet roasted pineapple.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn&apos;t really get much smokiness, per se&mdash;the fire is
          usually a simple gas fire&mdash;but it does get a little bit of singed
          char. Those in the know will ask for theirs to be cooked up
          extra-crisp on the plancha after it&apos;s been sliced. The results
          are almost bacon-like in their succulence.
        </p>

          <h3>Directions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Place chiles in a large saucepan over medium high heat and cook,
              turning chiles occasionally, until puffed, pliable, lightly
              browned in spots, and very aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add chicken
              stock (it should boil immediately), then pour contents of pan into
              a small bowl. Cover loosely and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wipe out saucepan, add oil, and return to medium-high heat until
              oil is shimmering. Add cumin, oregano, and achiote and cook,
              stirring frequently, until aromatic but not browned, about 30
              seconds. Add chipotle chile and sauce and cook until aromatic,
              about 30 seconds longer. Add vinegar, salt, and sugar and remove
              from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scrape contents of saucepan into a blender along with garlic and
              chiles with their soaking liquid. Blend on high speed until
              completely smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as
              necessary. Set sauce aside to cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using a very sharp chef&apos;s knife or slicing knife, slice pork
              sirloin as thin as possible. If necessary, place meat in freezer
              for 15 minutes to firm it up. Split the sides of a heavy duty
              zipper-lock bag. Place one slice of meat inside bag and pound with
              the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet or a meat pounder until less
              than 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with
              remaining meat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add marinade to bowl and toss with hands until every piece of meat
              is evenly coated in marinade.
            </li>
            <li>
              Line the bottom of a disposable aluminum loaf pan with a layer of
              bacon. Add a layer of thin-sliced marinated meat. Continue
              layering in bacon and meat until all the meat is used. (It may
              pile above the pan a little bit. This is ok.) Cover tightly with
              plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To cook indoors</strong>: Preheat the oven to 275&deg;F.
              Uncover aluminum loaf pan and place on a foil-lined rimmed baking
              sheet. Transfer to oven and cook until meat is completely tender
              (It will drip lots of fat), about 4 hours. Remove from oven, allow
              to cool slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate for at
              least 2 hours and up to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To cook outdoors</strong>: Light half a chimney of
              charcoal and allow to preheat until coals are mostly covered in
              gray ash. Spread out under one half of coal grate, and place
              cooking grate on top. Alternatively, set one set of burners on a
              gas grill to low and leave the remaining burners off. Unwrap
              aluminum loaf pan and place directly over cooler side of grill,
              placing a drip pan underneath if desired. Cover grill and cook
              until loaf registers 180 to 190&deg;F in the center, about 4
              hours, adding more coals to grill or adjusting burners as
              necessary to maintain an air temperature of around 275&deg;F for
              the duration of cooking. Remove from grill, allow to cool
              slightly, cover with aluminum foil, and refrigerate at least 2
              hours and up to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To Serve</strong>: Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Remove
              cooked meat from aluminum tray, scraping off any fat or jellied
              juices from its sides. Use a spoon to collect fat and juices from
              tray, reserving each separately. Using a sharp chef&apos;s knife
              or slicing knife, slice meat as thinly as possible to create fine
              shavings of meat and fat. Transfer to a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              If fat from meat is solid, heat gently in the microwave or in the
              oven until melted. Transfer pineapple pieces to a rimmed baking
              sheet lined with aluminum foil. Brush with fat. Transfer to oven
              and roast until completely tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from
              oven and allow to cool slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
              About 10 minutes before pineapple is done roasting, transfer meat
              and 1 tablespoon of fat to a large cast iron or non-stick skillet.
              Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until meat
              crisps and deeply browns in spots. Add any reserved juices and
              toss to combine, allowing it to cook until reduced to a moist
              glaze. Transfer meat to a warmed serving bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chop roasted pineapple into large chunks. Serve meat and pineapple
              immediately with warmed tortillas, onion, cilantro, salsa, and
              lime wedges. Meat will be very moist and should be packed into
              double-stacked tortillas for serving.
